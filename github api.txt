GitHub API Integration Module
==============================

Module : piece of code or group of files or single file that is reusable.

What is problem :
Now every organization is using version control
API = application interface

Suppose your manager comes to you and asks for details about how many members are active in github and how many repos are created and by who ?
You as a devops engineer in the company manages 3-4 teams and we are working with GitHub.
So i want to provide some script and password to the manager and he/she once runs the script it gives the output.
Here we are using the GitHub API module to integrate into their automation.

Suppose 3-4 teams are there in the company in that one team x is doing high level automation like they are integrating using Jira —> GitHub—-> bugzilla —-> reporting. so it is impossible to do this task by manually so we are using some high level scripting to understand the users list in the github.

We put shell scripts in the github organizational github repo. (Real time scripting)

shell script:
================

#!/bin/bash
################################
# Author: prashanth
# Version: v1
#
# This script will help users to communicate and retrieve information from GitHub
# Usage:
# Please provide your github token and rest api to the script as input
#
################################

if [ ${#@} -lt 2 ]; then
    echo "usage: $0 [your github token] [REST expression]"
    exit 1;
fi

GITHUB_TOKEN=$1
GITHUB_API_REST=$2

GITHUB_API_HEADER_ACCEPT="Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"

temp=`basename $0`
TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/${temp}.XXXXXX` || exit 1


function rest_call {
    curl -s $1 -H "${GITHUB_API_HEADER_ACCEPT}" -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" >> $TMPFILE
}

# single page result-s (no pagination), have no Link: section, the grep result is empty
last_page=`curl -s -I "https://api.github.com${GITHUB_API_REST}" -H "${GITHUB_API_HEADER_ACCEPT}" -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" | grep '^Link:' | sed -e 's/^Link:.*page=//g' -e 's/>.*$//g'`

# does this result use pagination?
if [ -z "$last_page" ]; then
    # no - this result has only one page
    rest_call "https://api.github.com${GITHUB_API_REST}"
else

    # yes - this result is on multiple pages
    for p in `seq 1 $last_page`; do
        rest_call "https://api.github.com${GITHUB_API_REST}?page=$p"
    done
fi

cat $TMPFILE



==============================END================================

First run the script it will ask you the password and enter the password

$ ./github_users_script.sh 

after that you integrate the password with $password

$ ./github_user_script.sh $password /orgs/<company-name>/repos

it will give you the whole repos are created by you in the organization.

/orgs/comapny-name/repos : this info is provided by git hub docs ..in the docs go to rest api and search for repo's


so now i don't want repos i want particular user or users

$ ./github_user_script.sh $password /user or users

this script we can also use in jira or any other platform.

and finally we can give it to this script asking by your manager for list in the github.
